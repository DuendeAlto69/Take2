            "I first saw her on a zoom call and I thought to myself this has to be the prettiest girl
             i've ever seen! I couldn't take mt eyes off of her, I thought to myself "Why have I never 
             seen her before" (I had lived in this ward for my whole life and I had never seen her before).
             "She must be new to the ward" I thought, but sadly this was covid times so I had no way of
             meeting her in person or to get her number. So I had to wait it out until I finally laid eyes on 
             her in person. We had an in person sunday school class at the park and she was there. Being the 
             courageous person I was I didn't saya t hing to her. I didn't even speak a word to her until one
             fateful day when we had a activity at a local pool and we both happened to go. I was being a boy
             and I was playing a keepaway game with a ball and a long throw went right to her and I didn't 
             even know her name but I asked for the ball at the same time a leader she knew asked for it. I 
             was very lucky and she handed me the ball as the leader said "Ohhhhh I see how it is" I smirked
             happily knowing I wanted to really meet her. Then the first time I really talked with her was when 
             I went to a couple day youth camp where we hit it off. I hoped I wasn't being too obvious as I was 
             practically glued to her any chance I had. There was one fateful night where we just stayed up all 
             night talking by a fire and laughing and that's when I first knew that I loved this girl. There was
             just one major problem, I was about to leave on an LDS mission and didn't have very much time to spend
             with her. I did my best and I got her number and we talked and talked all the time even when I was
             in the home MTC. Then I left but she continued to email me every single week. Until one day the emails
             stopped. I thought to myself "Oh no, she got a boyfriend" I hoped it wasn't true but the emails grew
             scarse and then finally I got an email a few months later saying she had broken up with her boyfriend
             as she proceeded to tell me that she would be waiting for me and I got excited. We grew really close over
             those two years even though we never saw each other in person. The first week I was back I went on a date 
             with her and it was like I had never even left. Things got serious very quickly within a couple of weeks
             we were offically dating and shortly after we said the powerful words "I love you". Then just four months 
             after I had returned home we were enagaged. Time has flown very quickly since that day. We now are only 10 short 
             days away from being married. I am so excited to marry the love of my life and my best friend. I love
             her more than I can descibe with words and I know that she loves me too. She has made me the happiest
             man to ever walk this earth and I will treat her the way she deserves it for the rest of time and eternity."

            We now have an apartment, or rather I am living in our future apartment where we'll live after the 
            wedding day. After we return from the honeymoon we'll live here together and spend the rest of our lives 
            happily ever after.
